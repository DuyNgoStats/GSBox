- The GSBox package provides utilities to visulize and obtain summary statistics of a sample of coherence matrices from multivariate time series (EEG signals). It also includes rank-based tests using log-Euclidean metric to compare two samples of coherence matrices.

- To install the package, download the package and run the following R code:
> devtools::install_local("GSBox_0.1.0.tar.gz")

- The following examples to illustrate methods in GSBox package:

 + Example GSBox: simulate multivariate time series from AR(2) processes and construct GSBox. 
 + Example rank-based test: simulate two (indepedent/dependent) samples of multivariate time series from AR(2) processes and perform rank-based tests. 
 + Example rank-based test HD: perform rank-based tests on high dimension multivariate time series.
 + Example rank-based test NS: perform rank-based tests on non-stationary multivariate time series
